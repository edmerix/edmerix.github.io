# edmerix.github.io
My "terminal-esque" personal website.
Very much in alpha stage, various things not functioning.
This is the static version of the site, and so multiple features have been removed.

__This needs to be updated to my new version of Terminal.js, using ES5/6 concepts and no dependencies (no jQuery!)__

### Misc

This has become a bloated version of my core Terminal.js class. Need to split some superfluous functions out of the core Terminal object and into an extending.js file, like in the core class files.
