				<h3>Brief overview of major metrics:</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/metrics.png" alt="Spike sorting metrics"/>
					<figcaption>
						<b>Single unit metrics</b>
						<br />
						<b>A.</b> Projection of clusters onto the Fisher linear discriminant, showing (i) two units from the same channel that are well isolated from one another, and (ii) a unit that has likely been incorrectly split into two clusters.
						<b>B.</b> A measure of the estimated number of false negatives from a given unit. Histograms of the voltage at the detected trough of each waveform in the cluster, divided by the threshold for detection, with a Gaussian curve fitted.
						<b>C.</b> Histogram of the Mahalanobis distance for each waveform principal component score from that unit's centroid in principal component space. For a normal distribution, the Mahalanobis distances form a chi-squared distribution (blue line), which can be used to detect outliers.
						<b>D.</b> Standard deviation through time (deep blue line, top) for all waveforms from a given unit (bottom). The standard deviation of the full signal during that epoch is shown (red, dashed line), along with the 95% confidence intervals derived from the chi-squared distribution, given the number of spikes within the unit (red shading). Scale bars are 20 &mu;V and 0.2 ms throughout the figure.

				<h3>What you're up against:</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/longterm.png" alt="Drifting single unit over 48 hours"/>
					<figcaption>
						<b>Ability to follow drifting clusters in principal component space over a prolonged period.</b>
						<br />
						An example putative single unit that showed a large alteration in waveform over a 40 hour period, but could be traced through time as a cluster in principal component space. 
						<b>A.</b> First principal component scores versus time, from 180 second epochs taken every hour, with background noise from distal cells in grey, and a well isolated single unit in blue. Highlighted (grey background) epochs are shown in more detail in <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.
						<b>B.</b> First versus second principal component scores for epochs highlighted in <i>A</i>, showing the maintained separation throughout. <b>C.</b> All waveforms from highlighted epochs, showing change in extracellular action potential shape.

				<h3>That said, stability is in there:</h3>

						<b>Stability of single unit features over 24 hours</b>
						<br />
						Tracking units by wave shape, PC score, and importantly, cell-intrinsic autocorrelation patterns.<br />
						Tracking units with 180 s epochs every 6 hours showed:<br />
						<ul>
							<li>76 single units identified total</li>
							<li>54 (71%) visible in each epoch</li>
							<li>1 visible in just a single epoch</li>
							<li>12 (16%) gained</li>
							<li>4 (5%) lost</li>
							<li>5 (6.5%) lost temporarily</li>
						</ul>

				<h3>Tracking unit identities:</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/tracking.png" alt="Tracking unit IDs using PC drift and ISI distance"/>
					<figcaption>
						<b>Single unit stability metrics</b>
						<br />
						To check units are the same, we can assess the drift of their centroid in cluster space (<b>A</b> and <b>B</b>) and their ISI distance, which captures a cell-intrinsic feature and thus doesn't change as a function of physical movement (<b>C</b> and <b>D</b>).
						<br /><br />
						To confirm these identities, we can build a "null" distribution by comparing across units from different electrodes (assuming electrodes are distal enough to be sure single neurons can only be captured on one at a time), and then compare values using a Mann-Whitney U test.

				<h3>Watch out for:</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="img/lookout.png" alt="Sudden shift in single neuron waveform"/>
					<figcaption>
						<b>Sudden alteration in isolated single unit waveform</b>
						<br />
						Stability in one metric doesn't require stability in the others!
						<br /><br />
						Here we see two apparently very distinct clusters in <b>A.</b> PC space and <b>B.</b> waveform (red and blue), but checking <b>C.</b> autocorrelations, <b>D.</b> PC score through time, and <b>E.</b> firing rate, we can clearly see it's one unit with a sudden waveform alteration.

				<h2>Unit subclassification</h2>
				<div class="desc">
					For a Matlab tool for simple(-ish) unit subclassification by cell type, check out my <a href="https://github.com/edmerix/UnitSubclassify" target="_blank">UnitSubclassify tool on GitHub</a>, which also includes screenshots of an exemplary putative fast-spiking interneuron and regular spiking pyramidal cell.
					<br /><br />
					It also touches on some caveats and references on why we should be careful subclassifying in neocortical data.

				<h2>Toolboxes worth checking out</h2>
				<div class="desc">
					Three modern spike sorting toolboxes that I'm keen to try out after I publish current work:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort2" target="_blank">Kilosort</a> (version 2 just released)</li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainsort_examples/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">MountainSort</a></li>
