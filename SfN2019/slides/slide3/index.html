		<li>For population analyses, neurons from Utah array recordings were classified as putative PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons or regular spiking cells (primarily pyramidal) using broadband spike FWHM and the cell-intrinsic mean autocorrelation lag</li>
		<li>Previously, activity from these cells could not be tracked through ictal recruitment due to waveform changes&mdash;especially interneurons due to their smaller amplitude spikes</li>

	<ol>
		<li>As the wavefront approaches, interneuronal firing increases and shifts out of phase, confirming recent animal work (Miri <i>et al.</i>, 2018)</li>
		<li>This is followed by increased pyramidal cell firing</li>
		<li>Maximal firing is during the wavefront, but both cell types maintain firing rates significantly above baseline</li>
		<li>Pyramidal cell firing continues to be reduced after interneuronal activity until tonic firing as the seizure invades</li>
	</ol>

	Evidence that interneuron firing increases only transiently, then decreases prior to pyramidal cells, suggesting a two-step process of seizure propagation
