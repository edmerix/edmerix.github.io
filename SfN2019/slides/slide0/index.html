	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		The intracellular hallmark of epileptic activity requires action potential alterations (Goldensohn &amp; Purpura, 1963), though little evidence has been found in studies of single neurons in humans (Bower <i>et al.</i>, 2012).
	</p>
	<p>
		We developed a novel spike sorting method to overcome the inability to track neurons in seizing brain (Merricks <i>et al.</i>, 2015) and analyzed a total of <b>1,239</b> single units from 41 seizures in 27 patients with medically intractable epilepsy (6 with Utah arrays, 21 with Behnke-Fried microwires) to determine extracellular correlates of these features &amp; analyze cell-type specific activity through seizures.

		<li>3D convex hulls are built around pre-ictal units in principal component (PC) space. Scores are calculated for the ictal waveforms based on pre-ictal PCs, and waveforms that fit within these convex hulls are added as putative matches</li>
		<li>Outliers were removed from the tail of a chi-squared distribution for the Mahalanobis distances for each unit</li>
		<li>Waveform match probability was calculated by the Gaussian distributions of voltage through time of the original pre-ictal units</li>
