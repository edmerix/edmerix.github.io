		<li>We used these metrics to differentiate between recruited and unrecruited tissue in Behnke-Fried recordings</li>
		<li>The two types of neuronal behavior during seizures were evident in single unit activity in these recordings and corresponded well with the clinical determination of seizure onset &amp; spread.</li>
		<li>Recruitment could be detected using these methods without the need for a clear passage of the ictal wavefront in the MUA, which is not readily accessible in Behnke-Fried recordings</li>
		<li>Waveshape changes occurred with a delay between sites, in keeping with propagation of ictal activity, and discounting motion or reference artifacts</li>

		<li>In 7 seizures (21%) from 5 patients (24%) both types of neuronal activity occurred simultaneously at different locations with <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 in one location and &ge; 0.05 in another; Holm-Bonferroni corrected Mann-Whitney U test</li>
		<li>This supports the concept of locally recruited neurons, with a penumbral response without waveshape changes in brain regions outside the recruited territory due to downstream excitatory effects</li>
